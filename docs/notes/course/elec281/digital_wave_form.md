# Digital Wave Form
Digital waves consist of of voltage levels changing back and forth between High (1) and Low (0)

**Period (T):**
**Frequency (f):** How many times the signal repeats within a unit of time
**Angular Frequency (w):**
**Duty Cycle:** (Pulse Width / Period) * 100

Example

A device works under 1 MHZ clock. Find the total time needed to transfer 2 bytes of data seriously.

```text
f = 1 mhz = 1 / T


T = 1 / 1 mhz = 1 / 1x10^6 = 10 ^-6
```
